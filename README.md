# mysql-vcs README

This is the README for your extension "mysql-vcs". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

Just imagine having a database in your vscode, how about that.


## Requirements

Just some default configuration stuff. Commands will do 90% of the work.

## Extension Settings

This extension has (or will have, whatever) the following important command:

* `mysql-vcs.config`: this will add a `mysql_config.json` file under `.vscode` folder on your root project

## Known Issues

Yea, this is still in dev so I guess the most known issue is that nothing works, and I know why.

## Release Notes

I'll set it up as soon as I release (around June 22 I hope).

### 1.0.0

I think I'll start from version 2.3.4 just to add confusion
